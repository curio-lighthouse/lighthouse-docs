# FAQs

## What is LiDAR?

LiDAR stands for Light Detection And Ranging.  LiDAR is a method for measuring distances using a laser and optical sensor combination device.  A LiDAR device functions by measuring the time between shining the laser on an object and the optical sensor detecting the laser light reflected back by object.  Using the speed of light and the time measurement, the LiDAR device is able to calculate the distance to the object reflecting the laser light.

#### LiDAR is commonly used in:

* Autonomous vehicles
* Warehouse automation
* Floor planning and mapping
* Drone and robot obstacle avoidance 

## What is lighthouse?

**lighthouse** is a solution to providing developers and consumers with an easy and ready to use LiDAR device.  Users can download apps built for lighthouse and immediately start using lighthouse.  

For Developers; lighthouse is a lightweight and easy to integrate solution for building LiDAR apps. 

## How does lighthouse compare to other existing LiDAR products?

**lighthouse** is a consumer ready product.  It's battery powered and connectable via Bluetooth while still maintaining a price which is inline with LiDAR devices which need integration into a full product.  **lighthouse** is ready for the consumer and developer right out of the box - just turn it on and connect!

We've noticed a lack in documentation for existing LiDAR devices and so we've made it our goal to provide as much developer support and documentation as possible in order to expand accessibility to LiDAR technology.

## How long does the battery last?

You should expect roughly 3 hours while **lighthouse** is spinning \(running and collecting data\).  Or 6 hours while on stand-by \(not spinning or collecting data\).

Charging should take about 1 hour for a completely drained battery.

## Does lighthouse support IOS?

At this time **lighthouse** does not support IOS.

{% hint style="info" %}
We have planned to add IOS integration in the near future!  In order to support IOS, we will need to allow connections to Lighthouse using either Bluetooth or Wifi.  Currently, Lighthouse supports Bluetooth connections, however, IOS restricts data transferring over Bluetooth for non-Apple-approved products.  Thus, we will need to add functionality to transfer data to IOS devices over Wifi instead.

## What can I do with lighthouse?

There are plenty of applications for LiDAR, we would love to see what you can do!

* Room mapping/Floor planning
* Robot navigation and automation
* Security
* Virtual touchscreen, human computer interface
* Social distancing

Let us know what you've built and we'll feature it here!

## Do you offer discounts for educators and researchers?

Yes!  Please get in touch with us: support@curiolighthouse.com

## Does lighthouse work in the dark?

Yes.  Due to the way LiDAR works, **lighthouse** will actually provide better results when in dim light environments.

## Can I modify the hardware or integrate with the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins?

No, not without voiding your warranty.  The reasoning behind this decision is because the Raspberry Pi Zero W is a fairly sensitive device - accidentally switching the power wires or other small errors can kill the board, even if the connection occurred for just a mere second.  

## Why can't I buy the battery powered Lighthouse outside the US?

Due to the restrictions on shipping batteries and battery powered devices internationally, we chosen not to offer the battery powered Lighthouse to international customers.  

International customers are still able to purchase the USB powered Lighthouse device or Build-Your-Own kits!

## Is there a battery powered Build-Your-Own kit?

No.  Batteries can be pretty destructive devices if shorted and mistakenly connected.  As such, we've decided against having a Build-Your-Own kit with a battery. 

## How is the Build-Your-Own Lighthouse powered?

Micro USB.

## Do I need to know how to code for the Build-Your-Own kits?

Absolutely not!  The Build-Your-Own kits are designed for anyone and everyone to easily build their own Lighthouse device!

## Do the Build-Your-Own kits include a Raspberry Pi or Micro SD card?

The Build-Your-Own kits do not include a Raspberry Pi or Micro SD card.  You will need your own Raspberry Pi Zero W and Micro SD card.  

We didn't want to make customers who already have a Raspberry Pi Zero W or Micro SD card available have to buy another.  Re-use your Raspberry Pi Zero W and SD cards across projects!

## Can I remove my Raspberry Pi Zero W from Lighthouse

You can only remove the Raspberry Pi Zero W from the **Build-Your-Own** kits.  The preassembled Lighthouse has an internal Raspberry Pi that is soldered in place and the case is sealed.

## Where is Curio located?

We are located in Rochester, NY!

## Do you accept returns?

Orders can be returned within 5 days of delivery to the original US destination.  **International orders cannot be returned**.  Read how to qualify and file a return on the [Returns Page](returns.md)
