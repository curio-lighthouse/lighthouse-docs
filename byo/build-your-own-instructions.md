### Steps:

Splice the **Black** wire from the LiDAR module motor with the **Yellow/Orange** wire from the LiDAR unit.

Splice the **Green** wire from the LiDAR module with the **Green** DuPont wire provided in the bag.

Splice the **Brown** wire from the LiDAR module with the **Brown** DuPont wire provided in the bag.

Splice the _two_ **Red** wires from the LiDAR module with the **Red** DuPont wire provided in the bag.

Splice the **Black** wire from the LiDAR module, which is NOT connected with the Yellow/Orange wire, with the **Black** DuPont wire provided in the bag

![](../.gitbook/assets/img_1662.jpg)

Heat shrink all of the spliced connections you've made.  Make sure to leave some extra heatshrink if you plan on soldering to your Raspberry Pi Zero W.

Solder the **Red** wire from male Micro USB plug to the **Out+** hole of the micro USB board.

Solder the **Black** DuPont wire from the male Micro USB plug to the **Out-** hole of the micro USB board.

Attach the micro USB board to the Lighthouse case by sliding towards the port hole with the board with the USB port facing away from the center of the case.  Once the board has slide forward, you can gently press down on the board to snap it in place.  

{% hint style="warning" %}


Sliding forward and snapping the micro USB board into place should not take much force.  You may need to wiggle it back and forth in order to slide it completely forward.  Using too much force could result in damage to the board or Lighthouse case.

Plug the male Micro USB plug into the **PWR** micro USB port on your Raspberry Pi Zero W

![](../.gitbook/assets/img_1659.jpg)

Either plug the female DuPont wires from the LiDAR module onto the header pins of the Raspberry Pi Zero W, or solder the wires to the GPIO Pins, as shown below:

Secure the Raspberry Pi Zero W to 4 short pillars in the Lighthouse case using the shortest screws provided in the bag.

![](../.gitbook/assets/img_1654.jpg)

Secure the LiDAR module onto the Lighthouse case by lining up the four screw holes of the LiDAR module with the taller pillars in the Lighthouse case.  Use the longest screws to attach the LiDAR module with the Lighthouse case.

Line up the electrical cover and screw it in place using the remaining two screws.

{% hint style="info" %}
Optionally you may super glue the **top cover** onto the **electrical cover.**
