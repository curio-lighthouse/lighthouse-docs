## What is LiDAR?

LiDAR stands for Light Detection And Ranging and is a method for measuring distances using a laser and optical sensor combination device.  A LiDAR device functions by measuring the time between shining the laser on an object and the optical sensor detecting the laser light reflected back by object.  Using the speed of light and the time measurement, the LiDAR device is able to calculate the distance to the object reflecting the laser light.

#### LiDAR is commonly used in:

* Autonomous vehicles
* Warehouse automation
* Floor planning and mapping
* Drone and robot obstacle avoidance 

## What is lighthouse?

**lighthouse** is a solution to providing developers and consumers with an easy and ready to use LiDAR device.  Users can download apps built for lighthouse and immediately start using lighthouse.  

For Developers; lighthouse is a lightweight and easy to integrate solution for building LiDAR apps. 

## How does lighthouse compare to other existing LiDAR products?

**lighthouse** is full product.  It's battery powered and connectable via Bluetooth while still maintaining a price which is inline with LiDAR devices which need integration into a full product.  **lighthouse** is ready for the consumer and developer right out of the box - just turn it on and connect!

We've noticed a lack in documentation for existing LiDAR devices and so we've made it our goal to provide as much developer support and documentation as possible in order to expand accessibility to LiDAR technology.

## Does lighthouse support IOS?

At this time **lighthouse** does not support IOS.

{% hint style="info" %}
We have planned to add IOS integration in the near future!
{% endhint %}

## What can I do with lighthouse?

There are plenty of applications for LiDAR, we would love to see what you can do!

* Room mapping/Floor planning
* Robot navigation and automation
* Security
* Virtual touchscreen
* Social distancing
