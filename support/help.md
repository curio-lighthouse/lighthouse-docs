## Charging

{% hint style="info" %}
Lighthouse does not come with a micro-usb charging cable. 
{% endhint %}

Charging Lighthouse requires plugging a micro-usb cable into the micro-usb port located on the side of Lighthouse under the power switch and micro-sd card slot.

#### Charging while powered on

Lighthouse supports uninterrupted charging and removal from charging while powered on.  Granted you Lighthouse is charged enough, you can unplug the device from the charger while it's on and never lose power.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Ensure the charger used supplies less 2A of power at 5v.  Lighthouse is not guaranteed to support chargers which supply more than 2A of power.  An official Apple iPhone charger works great!
