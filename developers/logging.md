# Logging

There is a log file containing logging output from the Raspberry Pi scripts. 

This script can be located in the root directory of the Raspberry Pi here:

```text
/lighthouse.out
```

{% hint style="info" %}
A good way to view this file in realtime through an ssh connection with the Raspberry Pi is the command below
{% endhint %}

```text
tail -f /lighthouse.out
```
